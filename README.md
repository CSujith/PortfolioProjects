# PortfolioProjects

This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from my Portfolio projects. The purpose of these projects is to showcase my analystical and technical skills.

Please feel free to take these and run with them. Make them your own and find you own insights

I really do hope these are helpful for you! :D
